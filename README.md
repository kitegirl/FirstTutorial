Create a scrollable one page website in Meteor

Hallo and welcome to my first tutorial. In this tutorial I will explain how you can create a one page website in Meteor with CSS, HTML and Javascript. The website will contain different blocks of content which can be accessed through scrolling, the navigation bar on the top and the anchor bar on the right/left. This layout is very popular at the moment and I spent a lot of time looking for such a tutorial, so now that I know how it works I wanted to share it with you. The tutorial is aimed at beginners and I will try to make it very easy to follow.

If you want to get an idea of what the website will look like, check out this link: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage

The tutorial is used on the lawshe:full-page package.

The site looks something like this:
